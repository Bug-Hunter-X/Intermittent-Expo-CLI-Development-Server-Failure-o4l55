# Intermittent Expo CLI Development Server Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI development server intermittently fails to start, providing unhelpful error messages. The issue is inconsistent and difficult to debug.

## Bug Description

The Expo CLI development server sometimes fails to start, displaying vague error messages related to port conflicts or unexpected termination.  The issue occurs randomly and restarting the machine or CLI provides only temporary relief.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the command line.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the behavior; the server might start successfully, or it might fail with an unclear error message. This inconsistency makes reproduction somewhat unreliable.

## Potential Solutions (and why they didn't work in this case)

* **Checking for port conflicts:**  We checked for any processes using the standard Expo port (19000 or 19001), but none were found.
* **Restarting the computer:** Temporarily fixed the issue, but the problem reappeared.
* **Reinstalling Expo CLI:** No effect.
* **Checking for conflicting packages:**  No conflicting packages found.

## Solution (in expoBugSolution.js)

While a definitive solution isn't provided due to the inconsistent nature of the bug, we include potential strategies to gather more helpful debugging info in the solution file.

## Note

This bug may be related to specific system configurations, background processes, or interactions between Expo CLI and other software. More investigation is needed to find a consistent solution.
