The inconsistent nature of the bug makes providing a perfect solution difficult. However, here's a strategy to improve debugging: 

1. **Detailed Logging:** Enhance the Expo CLI's logging capabilities by adding additional logging statements at various stages of the server start-up process to pinpoint the exact point of failure.  This might involve patching the Expo CLI source itself or using a debugger to step through the startup sequence. 

2. **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to control the port and other server settings, and use unique values during debugging.  This can help eliminate the possibility of external conflicts. 

3. **System Monitoring:** During the reproduction of the bug, monitor system resource usage (CPU, memory, network) to see if any resource bottlenecks or unusual activity coincide with the server crash. 

4. **Clean Install:** A clean reinstallation of Node.js, npm, and Expo CLI in a new, isolated environment might help. This helps rule out subtle dependency problems.
