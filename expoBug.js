While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server would intermittently fail to start, producing cryptic error messages related to port conflicts or unexpected termination. This happened inconsistently, making debugging difficult.  The error messages weren't always helpful in pinpointing the root cause, and restarting the computer or CLI sometimes resolved the problem temporarily, but it would reappear later.
